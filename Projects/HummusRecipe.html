    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

	<ul>
    	<li>1 can <strong>(400g)</strong> of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    	<li>175g of tahini</li>
    	<li>6 <strong>sundried</strong> tomatoes</li>
    	<li><strong>Half</strong> a red pepper</li>
    	<li>A <strong>pinch</strong> of cayenne pepper</li>
    	<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    	<li>A <strong>dash</strong> of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    	<li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    	<li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    	<li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    	<li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
        	<ul>
    			<li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
    			<li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
        	</ul>
    </ol>

    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

    <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
